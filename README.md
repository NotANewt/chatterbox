## Installation

This app requires the installation of express and mongoose to function. All are included in the package.json file and can be installed with the following input:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

The user invokes the in-terminal application with the following input:

```bash
nodemon
```

The server is then started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database. When the user opens API GET routes in Thunder Client for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When they test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Thunder Client, they are able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in their database. When a thought is deleted, its thought id is also deleted from the user data. When the user tests API, POST, and DELETE routes in Thunder Client, they are able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
